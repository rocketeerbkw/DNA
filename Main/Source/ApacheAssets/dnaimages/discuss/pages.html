	Thanks to all who have commented so far on the <a href="http://blog.apture.com/2008/08/buzz-about-apture-and-the-bbc/">linking trial</a>. We've also got quite a bit of feedback via the test pages, as we'd hoped, so thanks to those who responded there too. Most of it so far has been very positive. However, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment3">Pigsonthewings</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment9">Skipchris</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment12">Briantist</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment15">PicksyJ</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment16">Think4Yourself</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment18">Dazza71</a>, you have summed up one of the main reservations people are voicing which is why make the links anything other than standard hyperlinks (ie have we, as you say, opted for the "wheel reinvention" approach?).     The other issue that's come up fairly often is should we be linking to Wikipedia. The trial has still got a week or so to run and then we’ll go through all the feedback in more detail and decide what to do next.     NB. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/08/new_ways_of_linking.html#comment19">Edinberger</a>, your link suggestion has been noted.    Here are some more examples of what we are talking about: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7559517.stm ">Probe gets up close to Enceladus</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7560833.stm">Head of Roman empress unearthed</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7542791.stm">Driving primates to the edge</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7560330.stm">Noise complaint rights "face axe"</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7571973.stm">No 10's Clarkson video a "joke"</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7560986.stm">Lord Bruce-Lockhart dies aged 66</a>.
